# Hi, I’m Sovit Singh! 👋

## 👀 About Me
I’m an **Electronics Instructor** at Tulsipur Polytechnic Institute with a deep passion for **IC Design**, **Automation**, **Machine Learning**, and **RF Engineering**. I have experience working on diverse projects, including **RFID-based systems**, **image processing-based intrusion detection**, and cutting-edge technologies like **SDR (Software Defined Radio)**, **phased arrays**, and **drone-based sensing systems**.

## 🌱 What I’m Learning
I’m constantly expanding my knowledge to align with cutting-edge technologies. Here’s what I’m diving into:
- **Analog IC Design:** Exploring advanced concepts in circuit design through NPTEL courses.
- **Machine Learning (ML):** Constantly learning and actively implementing key concepts.
- **Automation & Robotics:** Working on integrating ML with embedded systems and SLAM for autonomous systems.
- **RF Engineering:** Experimenting with SDR, radar, and sonar for communication and environmental sensing.

## 💡 Projects I’m Working On
- **Bathymetry Using Drones:** Developing a system with SONAR, radar, and magnetometer technologies to locate missing vehicles in rivers.
- **Automation and ML Applications:** Combining ML algorithms with embedded systems for innovative solutions.
- **Analog and Mixed-Signal Design:** Using simulation tools like PSpice, MultiSim, and LTSpice for electronics design.

## 💞️ Collaboration Goals
I’m looking to collaborate on projects that:
- Merge **embedded systems** with **machine learning** and **automation**.
- Involve **RF technologies**, such as SDR or radar systems.
- Solve real-world problems using cutting-edge research and development.

If you share similar interests, I’d love to connect and explore ideas together!
